introduction tutorial short introduction statistic good basis of statistical thinking statistical test computed program r cf r development core statistic getting heart of matter necessary clear way stating statistic statistic indicator of true correct obtained result second statistics primarily mathematical calculation statistics substitute informed reasoning statistics way of quantifying assumption applied large datum set statistics indicator of correct result based calculation appropriate assumption interpreted result correctly big matter of careful consideration experience mechanical application of test procedure furthermore calculation of test trivial matter carried quickly accurately appropriate software software tell erroneous assumption violated condition of test software crunches number validity of result depends person entered number program finally statistic way describe data set draw inference outside of data set descriptive inferential statistic respectively condition describing drawing inference obviously means important define studied condition given test met data set typology of statistic statistic homogenous field useful think of term of broad paradigm frequentist approach result of statistical test conceived of of long hypothetical series of repeated experiment test ii bayesian iii explorative analysis approach purely descriptive tradition exemplified instance correspondence analysis considers observation correlation category n sized dimension space probably safe dominated practice teaching of statistic th century number of reason touch suffice primarily taught introductory statistic course university ii recently getting popular partially of increase computational power available bayesian statistics properly taught intermediate statistic course r r free open source version of programming language plus defacto standard statistical toolbox academic field addition free r number of advantage commercial statistical package spss idea of command line interface r faster easier work spss r flexible preparing datum applying statistical test statistical software package furthermore r linguistic specific function contained package languager harald baayen package like opennlp useful r reliable online statistic calculator difficult check reliability of calculator way of knowing long given web page hosting calculator available r like spss produces print quality graphic like figure chart type of datum notion of datum type crucial branch of statistic statistical test assumption type of datum picky necessary decide type datum hand closely correspond order choose appropriate test corpus linguistics dealing nominal datum nominal datum linguistic datum of nominal kind implies deals named category of thing like country beer type syntactic category datum unordered means rearranging affect information value listing country geographical size alphabetically affect property datum nominal datum referred count datum arithmetical operation allowed counted n bottle of beer ordinal datum ordinal datum ordered category of thing classic example score list race result winner finishing line important beat competitor magnitude of difference category affect information value kind of datum important thing order datum point continuous datum continuous datum thing measured continuous scale includes measured centimeter inch kilo pound year hour minute second etc key property differentiates kind of datum previous one reducibility meter composed of centimeter of centimeter millimeter of measured micrometer nanometer means number of arithmetic operation carried calculating mean value average height population easy interpret relation height of person e data point obvious interpret average number of child part of child missing child linguistics continuous datum found psycholinguistic reaction time experiment reaction time linguistic stimulus measured second millisecond study age of participant relevant bit of terminology population statistic means group collection of entity want population study population refer people light bulb car accident university student grammatical construction population occurs naturally defined purpose of research project sample subset of population want study sample sample carefully collected based pre defined criterion work sample happen available like historical linguistic random sample sample member of population random sample equal probability of included sample possible achieve statistical test assume sample drawn randomly distribution mathematical function case serve distribution model fair necessarily perfect model of population wish study model called normal gauss distribution continuous datum shape like bell

created like sign r assignment operator assigns material right hand short hand variable x matrix c nrow r code produces following output x entered r chi square test computed like circumstance r apply yates correction continuity pearson chi square test issue somewhat complicated good reason use yates corrected chi square order tell r use write argument correct false turns yates correction result of pearson chi square test interpreted interpretation of pearson chi square pearson chi square p value indicates probability of obtaining entire set of observation table provided observation random sample population null hypothesis appropriate word p value indicates null hypothesis set of observation random selection single chi square distributed population rejected low p linguistic social science somewhat arbitrarily set p choose reject null hypothesis p implicit alternative hypothesis of form set of observed value come different population example result of uncorrected pearson chi

population effect size instead of blindly trusting chi square p value note p value association observed value refers set of observation relation larger population observation association section effect size proper way report result of pearson chi square test include reporting result following information chi square value reported x squared r df value stands degree of freedom complicated concept falls outside scope of tutorial yates correction continuity p value value reported test e g p fisher exact test fisher exact test traditionally fisher exact test treated equivalent pearson chi square case pearson chi square considered inappropriate notably small sample size n case expected table cell value smaller test certain advantage certain limitation advantage conservative pearson chi square easily detect real relationship datum furthermore fisher exact test p value interpreted reasonable measure of size of observed effect e strength of association variable purpose of comparison cf footnote like pearson chi square r format of fisher exact test fx fisher test x r code fisher exact test run x table argument lot of information r datum x p value alternative hypothesis true odd ratio equal percent confidence interval sample estimate odd ratio present purpose ignore of information simply consider p value case pearson chisquare normally taken indicate result significant given conventional threshold of fisher exact p value interpreted likelihood of obtaining interpretation of fisher exact test observed table table extreme essentially larger difference observation additionally p value gives relative effect size adjusted observed frequency table context of corpus linguistic obvious role fisher exact test measure dependency collocation case of stefanowitsch gries
