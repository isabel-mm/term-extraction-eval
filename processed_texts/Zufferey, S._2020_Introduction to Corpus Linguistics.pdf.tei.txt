preface        linguistics progressively experienced fundamental methodological turning point   following work of american linguist noam chomsky   changed essentially rationalist discipline middle of    th century   gradually   opened empirical approach represented corpus linguistics experimental linguistics   past decade   transition accelerated   way majority of linguistic work published international journal currently use of empirical datum     linguistic corpora gradually established fundamental tool linguist   use spread field linguistics   including traditionally favoring rationalist approach   syntax   development of corpus linguistics led creation of new method collecting analyzing linguistic datum   possible thank development of computer arrival of internet   new

certain field syntax   following work of american linguist noam chomsky   fact   chomsky defended strictly rationalist methodological approach linguistics   fiercely opposed use of external datum   objection chomsky use of external datum linguistics numerous   briefly review   way of lost raison   tre context of current research   chomsky objection use of corpora   fundamental   corpora contain language sample produced speaker   according   linguistic focus linguistic performance of speaker   competence mother tongue   calls internal language     problem   people speak   produce
